# Post Human Era

To optimistic, positive, and intelligent humans!

## Preface

Humans, with the Latin scientific name homo sapiens, are the only known species possessing high intelligence, complex social structures, and advanced cultural development. We have existed on this blue marble of a planet for over 200,000 years, and today about 8 billion people are spread across the globe.

When the first golden rays of sunlight slip through the gaps between tall buildings or the greenery of residential courtyards into your room, you may still recall how, in childhood essays or comics, the red sun was always described as rising from behind distant mountains. Such scenes were easy to encounter in ancient times; nowadays, you need to go to the countryside to truly experience them. With the accelerating pace of urbanization, we have grown accustomed to living in environments reshaped and optimized by human hands. Perhaps it is a hurried hot breakfast in the morning, a cup of coffee or milk tea in the afternoon, and scrolling on your phone until you fall asleep at night—this is the everyday life we take for granted. The bustling traffic, neon lights, clinking of tableware, and endless chatter about work gossip and history surround us daily, becoming ordinary and familiar. Yet this lifestyle is not something that has existed since antiquity; it only appeared recently, though we live in it as naturally as if it were a law of physics that had always been there. This is a snapshot of human social progress to date, a reality we all feel, a phenomenon that emerged only recently despite humanity’s long evolutionary history. And this transformation is still continuing, with no end in sight.

Humans, after all, are products of nature. Our birth, development, and progress all follow natural laws. By adhering to these laws, we gain insights that guide how we advance further. Sustainable development was proposed in this context. Humanity now exerts a powerful influence on other species on this planet—resilient yet fragile. Earth, as the home of humans and countless other living beings, requires careful stewardship. To protect the Earth is, in fact, to protect the environment most suitable for human survival today.

As we exploit the natural world, we also regulate the methods and means of exploitation to ensure that the damage we cause remains controllable. This way, our actions are not short-sighted but can meet present needs while ensuring a thriving future. To achieve this goal, people have established many rules and vigorously developed science and technology, creating more sustainable production techniques. These advances drive progress in health, environment, culture, and convenience, allowing life to move forward continuously.

## Up to Now

In the vast history of 3.5 billion years, life on Earth has thrived endlessly. From the earliest bacteria discovered near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, to organisms that developed photosynthesis and gradually spread to shallow seas and land, and eventually to the emergence of animals—biodiversity has grown richer and richer, with over a million species now recorded. During this time, the development of animals—whether invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, or mammals—has been unstoppable.

Although we may not always perceive evolution happening around us, when we expand the timescale of observation, it becomes clear that the pace of evolution seems to be accelerating.

Fish first appeared about 410 million years ago in the Ordovician period, dinosaurs emerged around 240 million years ago in the Middle Triassic, and the earliest mammals appeared around the same time. These species are separated by vast spans of time, measured in hundreds of millions of years, with countless species arising and disappearing before reaching today. From this perspective, human history is extremely short. Homo sapiens appeared about 250,000 years ago, most of which we call early humans (archaic humans). Late humans (modern humans) only appeared about 50,000 years ago, and what we now call “modern humans” refers to those of the last 10,000 years.

Like dinosaurs, humans can be considered the dominant species of their era. Yet dinosaurs, despite surviving for 170 million years, never evolved into highly intelligent beings. Much of their waking time was consumed by feeding, with no large-scale agriculture or industry. In contrast, humans, with larger and more complex brains, invented and manufactured tools that freed them from mere subsistence, allowing more time to create advanced and practical tools to further improve life. This virtuous cycle included producing tools to make other tools, enhancing our ability to acquire resources in bulk. All of this stems from intelligence.

Upgrades in intelligence brought overwhelming advantages to the species. Even small increases yielded significant improvements. For example, once hunting tools were invented and widely used, humans gained crushing dominance over other animals. Early humans, through this skill and their growing ability for organized cooperation, caused many species to go extinct. As knowledge accumulated and new technologies were invented, efficiency improved, reducing pressures in many areas. The invention of trains and airplanes made the world feel smaller and more accessible. These advantages became increasingly obvious, and the pace of new capabilities accelerated.

From this perspective, compared to the slow pace of biological evolution through mutation, the enhancement of intelligence—and the resulting improvements in ability—has had far more significant impacts. If we treat this growth in intelligence as a form of evolution, and combine it with the timeline above, it is clear that evolution is accelerating.

Early Earth’s harsh environment, through chemical reactions, accidentally created organic matter and gave rise to life. Some organic molecules combined, and against astronomical odds, the first cell was born. Later, multicellular organisms emerged. As time went on, plants and animals diverged, experimenting with survival strategies in their environments and forming the earliest ecosystems. Species adapted and evolved, with intelligence gradually emerging among animals. Once intelligent beings proved successful in nature’s grand experiment, this path became unstoppable—like an arrow released from a bow. This direction of evolution was both accidental and inevitable, each step building upon the last, producing increasingly significant results. That is why evolution has become faster and more profound.

This acceleration mirrors the rapid progress of human culture and technology. The Code of Hammurabi in Babylon was issued around 1776 BCE, the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt was built around 2580 BCE, and the Yellow Emperor defeated Chiyou to become ruler around 2698 BCE. In the 5,000–6,000 years of human civilization, development has been continuous, with many leaps forward. Yet the major breakthroughs in productivity only began less than 300 years ago, and they came one after another: the First Industrial Revolution in the 18th century in Britain, when machines replaced hand tools; the Second Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, when the world entered the “Age of Electricity”; and the Third Industrial Revolution in the mid-20th century, marked by new scientific and technological advances.

In other words, much of the material and spiritual wealth we enjoy today only appeared or was improved very recently. The battlefield mobile telephone created by Bell Labs in 1940 was perhaps the earliest mobile phone; Apple’s first iPhone was released in January 2007, using 2G networks and a single 2-megapixel rear camera—by today’s standards, almost unusable. Reality is like this: we are immersed in the prosperity brought by modern science and technology, yet forget that this timespan is actually very short.

The development of all things seems to follow a J-shaped curve: flat at first, then steeply rising.

Today, in 2025, time flies through our fingers. The world around us seems calm and steady, yet sudden leaps forward happen unexpectedly. Daily life feels peaceful, but explosive progress surrounds us. Compared to the past, this pace is unimaginable. We are now living in the fastest era of technological advancement in history—and the future will only be faster. Humanity has stood at crossroads many times, but we can only keep moving forward, toward the stars and the sea, toward higher civilization.

## AI

In 2012, Google’s self-driving car obtained the first autonomous vehicle license in the United States. More than a decade later, it seems almost embarrassing for a car manufacturer not to have at least Level 2 autonomy. Artificial intelligence, once the subject of people’s hopes and imagination, has now entered households in a surprisingly short time.

In 2017, at a Go match in Wuzhen, Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated human world champion Ke Jie by 3–0. By the end of 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, representing generative pre-trained AI, swept across the globe. Soon after, DeepSeek emerged, introducing a mixture-of-experts architecture that reduced training costs. The AI race has become a flourishing field, with countless models competing and innovating at breathtaking speed.

Looking back at this rapidly accelerating timeline of technological progress, we have reason to believe that as time goes on, richer, more advanced, and bolder innovations and applications will appear at ever higher frequencies.

This phenomenon is easy to explain: imagine starting with only a few coins in your pocket, trying to build a business from scratch. The effort and luck required are immense. But once you reach an initial scale, replicating and improving becomes faster, thanks to experience and resources. As development continues, profits multiply, expansion accelerates, and new methods are adopted to grow horizontally and vertically. Eventually, globalization, diversification, and ecosystem building bring new opportunities.

When growth reaches a plateau, does Moore’s Law fail and everything stagnate? Not necessarily. Walmart seemed to hit the ceiling of retail, but soon Amazon and Tmall showed that e-commerce was a whole new level above. Similarly, Intel’s CPUs faced criticism for slowing performance gains, but GPUs and NPUs opened new paths for rapid progress. What looks like a limit often becomes the threshold for a new qualitative leap.

Technological development follows this pattern. Past knowledge provides both a solid foundation and practical tools for new directions. Standing on the shoulders of giants, we can produce more high-quality results in less time. This cascading evolution resembles a chain reaction—like the instant an atomic bomb ignites.

From knotted ropes to counting rods, abacuses, and slide rules, humans invented tools to simplify calculation. These tools freed us from tedious arithmetic, enabling faster and more accurate work in finance, construction, and statistics. They also laid the groundwork for designing new computing tools. In 1940, Alan Turing invented the Bombe to crack German Enigma codes; in 1946, the first generation of computers—vacuum tube digital machines—was born. After three generations of development, we arrived at today’s large-scale integrated circuit computers. Now, we use computers to design new computers, iterating generation after generation. This cascading evolution produces ever greater efficiency and value.

Artificial intelligence is part of this same background and subject to the same laws. Remarkably, AI is still in its early stages, yet progress has already been astonishing, with future potential beyond imagination. From Microsoft’s Cortana and early versions of Apple’s Siri to today’s Microsoft Copilot series and diverse intelligent agents, we have witnessed a dazzling transformation. These agents can compose poetry, create art, write essays, make videos, generate code, edit presentations, introduce knowledge, summarize information, give recommendations, and execute tasks. They serve both entertainment and productivity, becoming indispensable assistants in life, study, and work.

AI’s impact on industries is profound—benefiting many while disrupting others, even threatening to reshape future development models. Yet limitations remain: high operating costs, restricted input/output, and limited capability ranges. But as technology advances, models will evolve. Future systems may achieve today’s results with far less computing power, while hardware improvements and capital investment will provide more resources. When new foundational architectures emerge, intelligent agents will rise to a new level. At that point, today’s systems may be considered “primitive,” mere early-stage AI. And given the current pace of progress, that future is not far away—perhaps only a few years ahead.

## Where Do We Go From Here

“Faster, Higher, Stronger—Together.” As is well known, this is the Olympic motto. The fearless spirit of moving forward, daring to struggle, daring to win, never being satisfied, constantly overcoming and surpassing oneself to reach new goals and new realms—this is not only the ethos of competition, but also the everyday style of humanity.

Throughout the long river of human history, as production methods and other aspects advanced, we have often faced confusion and uncertainty. Yet in the end, we always moved toward brighter times. For example, during the First Industrial Revolution, machines replaced manual labor, leading to widespread unemployment and wage decline. Some workers saw machines as the root of poverty, and the Luddite movement emerged—workers destroyed machines to resist oppression and exploitation. But history rolled forward. Once employment security issues were resolved, large-scale industry became factory-based, assembly-line, and mechanized. Later, automation and intelligence were introduced. Every transformation brought pain, but soon new vitality sprouted, influencing all aspects of life.

Over the past two centuries, with the development of physics, chemistry, and biology, life sciences and medicine entered the track of scientific progress. Many radical treatments and supportive methods appeared, unimaginable in ancient times. For example, vaccines gave humanity proactive means to fight disease; MRI allowed doctors to examine internal organs and lesions with unprecedented clarity. With more advanced technologies, medicine provided stronger protection for human health, and some may eventually expand into new capabilities.

Prosthetics were originally designed to help disabled individuals live closer to normal lives. With the advent of brain–computer interfaces, though still limited in practicality today, we can expect that in the future, combining prosthetics with such interfaces will allow disabled people to achieve equal or even superior abilities compared to ordinary humans. Advanced mechanical structures, motors, and sensors could give prosthetics stronger performance and richer functions—for instance, bionic feet designed for enhanced jumping, or mechanical grips added to feet for tasks beyond walking. Maintenance and replacement would be simpler, making them potentially superior to natural limbs. With brain–computer interfaces transmitting human intent directly, not just sensing motion trends, these prosthetics could perform tasks more smoothly and precisely.

This expansion need not be limited to prosthetics. Exoskeletons and other external devices could be applied to healthy individuals as well, functioning like computer peripherals. With such support, commands and feedback could be transmitted via brain–computer interfaces, motion sensing, and AI prediction, enabling humans to perform abilities they never had before—without relying on keyboards or voice commands.

One day, as more powerful external devices are designed, natural limbs and organs may be used less frequently and gradually degenerate. Degeneration is not always frightening—the appendix is a typical example today. In the future, with technological support, more body parts and organs may degenerate, blurring the line between external devices and prosthetics.

Animals rely on instinct to survive and reproduce. These instincts are the result of centuries of selection and accumulation. Humans, however, have adjusted their environment on a massive scale to better suit collective survival. In this new environment, with new social relations and lifestyles, rationality became more important than instinct—for example, not panicking in emergencies. Rationality itself is a kind of evolution, enabling us to solve problems at a higher level. With rapid technological progress, adopting intelligent external devices is another higher-level evolutionary path, achieving effects that physical evolution alone cannot. These devices replace bodily functions just as rationality sometimes replaces instinct.

This process will bring doubt and opposition, just like the Industrial Revolution. People will stand at crossroads, weighing pros and cons. Yet after hesitation, society will gradually accept this trend, embracing a new model that creates infinite possibilities for future life. Intelligent external devices will gradually replace parts of our bodies, becoming part of us—making us faster, higher, stronger, and eventually, more united.

## Integration

As people adopt more and more intelligent external devices, and as these devices increasingly replace our original abilities, our dependence on them grows stronger. Eventually, we may choose to equip different types of devices according to our needs, but overall, these external aids will become indispensable parts of our bodies. At that point, calling them “external devices” may no longer be appropriate—“integrated intelligent components” would be a better term. After all, only by integrating them can we become complete, capable beings; without them, we would lose many abilities and struggle to survive.

These integrated intelligent components will be designed to ever higher standards, capable of replacing more and more of our natural functions. For example, new artificial eyes may surpass human vision with higher resolution, faster frame rates, wider color ranges, optical zoom, and even infrared perception. Integrated algorithms could help us focus on objects of interest, automatically supplement information, and search for items—like augmented reality, but more advanced and directly built into our bodies. Such components could be installed throughout our bodies, assisting both perception and action.

Behind all this lies an even more important force: AI. After long periods of rapid development, new generations of AI—far beyond today’s heuristic systems—will permeate every aspect of life, helping us achieve everything. AI will not only support specific tasks or entertainment, but also guide how we improve the very processes of progress. Integrated into intelligent components, AI will allow our brains to issue minimal instructions yet achieve rich, precise results. Moreover, the engineering design of these systems will itself be carried out by AI, which will also drive their continual evolution. Over time, AI will require less human intervention, self-improving like AlphaGo once did through self-play in Go.

Integration will transform our physical form, our way of thinking, and our way of living. At that point, are we still animals, still humans?

One could say yes. Even if many parts are replaced, our essence remains human flesh. Our will still originates in the brain, our blood still flows thanks to the heart. Though we cannot survive independently without these components, it is still humans who created and connected them, and they revolve around our ideas. From this perspective, we remain human, still animals.

But one could also say no. With AI augmentation and integrated components, our thinking changes drastically. Many body parts may be replaced, even the heart itself, and nutrition may be delivered through new, more efficient methods. These changes alter our priorities and pursuits. What we now consider vital—like health—may no longer be central, or may be redefined. From this perspective, we are no longer human, perhaps not even animals.

Whether we are “still human” may not matter much outside taxonomy. Yet we can set a definition: humanity becomes a new species when the proportion of replaced functions—especially core organs and brain processes—reaches a certain threshold. At that point, humans evolve into “new humans,” a new species born through artificial and AI-driven evolution. Importantly, since AI is itself a human creation, this process remains part of nature—though “nature” here refers to a broader sense than before.

With this transformation, lifestyles and aspirations will change dramatically. People will focus more on upgrading components, since these directly enhance personal abilities—like today’s pursuit of phones, bags, or cars, but far more impactful. As material needs are easily met, attention will shift to spiritual goals. Ultimately, these goals will center on long-term, high-quality enjoyment and affirmation of self-worth. Enjoyment means luxurious, carefree living; affirmation means proving one’s existence and answering the ultimate question: why do I live? In this future, advancing the evolution of all “new humans” will be the highest way to affirm self-worth.

In the end, the only real question is how to define the threshold of replacement. But regardless of the exact definition, a new species will emerge. And even this “new human” will be transitional—like Australopithecus before modern humans—destined to be replaced by even more advanced forms.

## New Domain

Evolution is still ongoing—and accelerating.

Indeed, for the “new human,” evolution is realized through the replacement of biological functions with integrated intelligent systems. Human bodily functions further degenerate, while intelligent agents expand in breadth and depth, covering more capabilities and applications at a rapid pace. From the moment of birth, individuals are already connected to sufficiently rich intelligent systems; moreover, through drugs and other means such as genetic editing, the growth of original biological functions is suppressed. Perhaps even the very definition of “birth” will change, and the word itself may acquire a new meaning.

Our decision-making brain also undergoes profound changes and challenges. Integrated intelligent components bring entirely new sensory and motor abilities, reshaping the way the brain thinks. Yet the greatest impact comes from another category of integrated intelligent components specifically designed to assist brain cognition.

Our brains store many memories, but we cannot remember everything. With the explosion of knowledge, the overwhelming flood of global information, and our enhanced sensory and motor capacities, the brain increasingly relies on these intelligent components to extend and augment its cognitive functions. 可是我们脑容量不够。但这没关系，大脑接入了用于额外存储的集成智能组件，其容量极大，存储速度和读取速度也都异常高效，我们原始的记忆好坏也不是那么重要了。而更厉害的是，通过云端还能实现公共信息的共享，例如一些现成的知识点和已经发生的事件，似乎已经植入我们的大脑，因为我们在尝试调用这部分资料时，存储集成智能组件通过云端部分，直接以记忆的方式返回给我们大脑。这意味着，我们似乎不需要学习了。这项必杀技能，可是现代许多人的百日梦，连什么喝杯知识饮料、插卡输入、数据线传输等手段都不需要，随想随有，实时更新，可谓所想披靡。这项技术，被称为潜在按需注入技术。

因此，如果你还对往集成智能组件方向发展持有保留意见，那么现在考虑到会拥有这项技能，想必你一定也开始考虑会支持这种发展方向了吧？事实上，这只是其中一个小例子，这一类优势会无所不在。存储可以被拓展，大脑算力更是如此：空间想象力、逻辑推理能力、判断力，有设计为高性能计算功能的集成智能组件来支撑，而其之上更有人工智能帮你完成思考和给出答案，让人类几乎各个都是天才。这项能力，与生俱来。

这里不得不提的一点是，这种能力拓展可不是一个可选项，而是必须项。当人体所接入的集成智能组件越来越多，且各集成智能组件本身的能力也非常强大，即便会通过 AI 来精简提取输入信息，以及自动扩展输出命令，但人原本的大脑已经完全无法支撑这海量的信息处理，也没有时间和机会给大脑来“纯天然”进化出能够承载这些额外增长的能力。无论是感知理解，还是驱动调用，大脑都会是瓶颈。例如，新型眼睛能够让我们感知更多的色彩空间、更大更精细的画面、更强的深度感知，还能在画面中以结构化信息的方式补充相关描述，这些信息过于丰富，即便是择其重点，也是我们当前大脑所无法承载的；同样，我们可以操控的“腿”和“脚”，可以根据完成的事情远比想在的多，因为这个“腿脚”已经不再是传统意义上的“腿脚”了，除了走路跑步踢腿等常规操作外，我们的座驾也以外设的形态，类似现在电脑与蓝牙鼠标那种关系，也串联在我们的“腿”上，我们可以直接控制它像车一样开行，抑或低空飞行，并时刻感知此过程中的各种反馈，就如同走路时能感知“脚”踩在的路面是否平坦那样。因此，对大脑能力的扩充，势在必行，以减轻其负担，也能更出色、准确、快捷地完成我们想执行的任何决定。

于是可预见的是，连大脑原本的许多机能都退化和被替换了，更别说身体的其它部位了。这可能匪夷所思，但无论是从需要，还是从必要的角度，这都会是一种演化的方向。这种方向能让每个人都变得前所未有的强大，就像我们现在无法再接受像猿猴一样整天在树林中飞来窜去，而猿猴可能也一时半会儿难以想象，以后将不再再森林里生活觅食，那该如何是好。当然，大家都会适应。随着城市用地对大自然的侵占，许多动物都被迫接受了我们创造的家园的形态，甚至产生了依赖，现如今猫狗宠物在人类的悉心照料下，甚至失去了野生时独立生存的基本能力，在人类的家中活得潇洒快乐。这些动物都是如此，考虑到新形式所带来的优势，人类接受和适应新的更优渥环境能力更不在话下。

人体绝大部分都已经被集成智能组件所替代，直到最终被全部更新替换。集成智能组件主要是有机分子材料和高级复合材料构成，因此不能简单认为是机器。但是不是碳基，则基于当时材料科学，以及对应的制造工艺和设计所决定，但已不再是人工制品，而是全 AI 设计和安排生产部署。当然，这些组件中也内置包含有许多先进计算单元和智能模型，方便在感知和执行时，能自发做出细节判断和适应性指令修正，就像我们现在的膝跳反射或肌肉记忆那样，只不过基于 AI，它更智能，甚至智能程度超过我们现在的大脑，因此能更好地去获取信息或完成指令。这些部件通过扩展、接入、融合的方式，逐渐接替人体各原生部位，以此彻底改变了原先人类及后续发展出来的新人类的组成形式和生活方式，形成了新的生命形态。

于此同时，生物分类学家（如果彼时还存在）又开始考虑，此时的物种应当更是与以往截然不同的。集成智能组件在人体在比例，从原来新人类的一部分，变成了几乎全部，甚至就是全部。由于集成智能组件覆盖率更高，加之经过一段时间发展后 AI 能力也更是进化发展到更高层度，由此当下物种的智力和能力也是显著更高。由于形态变得过于激进，因此需要从更高层次，实际上应该是从最高生物分类层级来进行区分，也就是产生了新的域，从原先的动物界所属的真核生物域里，分化出了全新的超智域，意为超级智慧，不再以生物形态和组成形式来命名，因为这不足以体现其特征，过往一切远不及的智力才是。根据是否尚有人类原生部位的保留存在，该界又往下层分为准超智界和全超智界，呈时间先后顺序，而这两个门的进化过程，也是比以往各类型都要远远快得多的，甚至耗时都没超过一年。

目前生物学家为了区分各物种而制定了生物分类系统，是一套根据相似程度而制定的分层分类体系，其从最上层往下依此是域、界、门、纲、目、科、属、种。为了方便起见，后面仍会以“人类”或“人们”一词来称呼经过此番进化的新物种。

## Humanities

随着后人类时代的沿着时间坐标继续推进，除了人类本身的形态以及周边环境发生了翻天覆地的巨大变化外，人们的思考方式也发生了巨变，从而导致文学、交流、艺术、娱乐、体育、旅游、信仰等多各文化领域产生了不可逆的革新。

在人类过往的历史上，文化众领域随着文明的诞生而逐步产生，紧接着不断丰富和充实。这个过程也出现过多次与时俱进地迭代更新。同时，受不同地域和民族在其客观条件和发展轨迹的不同所影响，逐渐出现了多样性；而这些多样性又随着人民之间的各项交流活动，出现了一定层度地融合和共同发展。时至今日，包容而多样的文化色彩，成为了地球村的色彩。扬长避短，求同存异，不断发展。

这个发展速度，从新人类的出现后，明显变得更快，就像踩下了油门一样。

受先进的集成智能组件支持，人们之间的沟通变得更为简单高效：人们之间不再需要拿出手机，通过打电话或文本聊天的方式与对方沟通，而是可以更为直接，因为这些集成智能组件都是联网的，因此他们之间本身便自带具有通信能力。基于此，A 想表达的内容，可以直接通过对应集成智能组件所支持的反馈能力，投影传入到 B 的大脑中。

有一天，A 正在参加一个画展，里面都是一幅幅精彩绝伦的油画。A 想把这个信息，尤其是此刻的感受传递给好友 B。当下我们能做的，可以是通过视频电话，透过有限像素的摄像头和小小的屏幕，将画面进行“直播”，再加上一番眉飞色舞的语言描述，来让 B 感受当前的场景。这种信息传递已经很丰富了，但其实整体效果依然会大打折扣。但新人类乃至后面的超智域人类则有更好的方式来传达这些信息。A 在进行参观的过程中，可以将其新型眼睛所捕获的完整影像和辅助信息中愿意分享的部分，通过网络直接串流同步至远方的 B。而 B 则能类似接受其自身新型眼睛里传入的影像和辅助信息一样，“身临其境”感受 A 分享过来的内容，完全如同自己看到了一样。在这个过程中，A 的语音内容能通过经网络直接传入 B 的“耳朵”里，然而现场其实 A 并没真的发出声音，一切都是通过 A 的音频输出集成智能组件（也就是我们传统的“喉咙”）直接将音频输出通过网络转发到 B 的听觉集成智能组件（也就是我们传统的“耳朵”）。音频可以是语音，也支持发出任何 A 想发出的其它形态的声音，例如音乐，借助新的喉咙，嗓子中似乎额外有了一整套乐器、音频素材和变声特效，而且用起来如此得心应手，就像我们现在平时说话那么自如一样。反过来，B 也以类似方式将回话路由转发给 A，并能直接在 A 的画面是框选标注，并将结果传递给 A，以此完成全程沟通。简洁、高效、明了。当然，背后也有一套分享内容完全控制和对方内容识别，以避免传递了一些不想分享的信息，以及屏蔽一些对方所发但自己不想关注的多余信息，再配上 AI 实时总结和辅助支持，整个过程非常安全、自然和简单。从此，沟通呈现出了更先进直观的方式。

随着沟通方式的颠覆，文学、艺术、娱乐也随之一并被颠覆。古往今来，琴棋书画、诗书辞赋、歌舞曲技、影视漫综，其内在的本质，无非是通过艺术化的方式，讲好一个故事，以带来共鸣，或描述一个事物，以介绍知识。人们在欣赏完艺术作品后，感受到我们认为作者想表达的内容，甚至引发我们更深层次的思考。这是一种较为高深优雅的信息传递手段，它利用了我们已掌握的表达技巧和传达能力，加以对信息呈现的美化处理，提升感染力，让人以更为享受的方式去进行接收。而我们从中能获得的情感很多，也很细腻丰富，快乐、悲伤、振奋、沉思，林林种种，而且互相交织，而有时又像得到汲取养分一样，从中收获不少。但随着新沟通方式的出现，这种感染和传播方式，似乎有更为直接的表达方式了。人们可以既把自己最原始的见闻直接进行传递，如同新的分享画展之旅那样；也可以把自己最直接的想法进行传递，语音清晰准确，并且还支持其它形态的声音；还可以把自己最基本的感受进行传递，例如心跳、体温、气息。

不过，其实并不太会发生上面这种场景。那时的人们，借助先进的各项集成智能组件，早已阅尽天下美景奇观和万世佳作，随需调阅各类渊博知识，因此对已有新奇事物并没太多主观刺激。肉身前往式的旅游也在此过程中消失，毕竟需要时，所能调用的外设皆为你的肉身。同时，优渥而便利的生活条件，解决了人们后顾之忧，因此也没什么愁容难过；便利有效的沟通，不容易产生矛盾，因此生气愤怒也不容易发生。在一切趋于完美后，人们会显得更为理性，因为感性的作用逐渐减弱，而理性又能提高各方面的效率和方便做出科学的判断。因此，最终人们的感情较为稳定，始终保持着相当程度的幸福感。相比之下，彼时人们的主要生活目标是证实自己的价值，而对这其中的感性传递，则只需要将所做的努力进行展示即刻。因此感性的传递几乎为零，人们更多的是通过沟通交流，将自己正在深入的研究领域所产生的最新成果进行分享，共同为全体知识和资源积累添砖加瓦，同时也展现了自身价值。

同样，体育也更不用说，人体的各类运动机能已被先进工程与智能技术所取代，这些集成智能组件始终拥有足够的性能，也包含完善简单的修复和替换方案。考虑到人们拥有按需远程操控能力，在需要的时候可以控制离自己物理距离很远或存在物理隔阂的其它外设；而且无需像现在这样，由大脑下发一连串指令给双手，在通过键盘、鼠标、操纵杆等方式对电脑或机械设备进行操作，以间接的方式来控制不属于人身体一部分的外部设备。人们为了操作许多设备是由大脑通过未来的神经系统——通用互联系统，直接进行控制和获取感知，更为直观高效。因此，健康永在，始终最佳。我们当今体育因此逐渐失去价值。

这么看来，沟通变得更为直接，可谓全新而高效。而文学、艺术、体育、娱乐、旅游，作为人类曾经的核心文化方式，在后续的进化中，慢慢消失。很遗憾，但也不必太难过，他们给我们留下了无数精神财富，至此使命以然结束，但并没因此消亡，而是以一种新的形态出现，继续创造更伟大的价值。至于信仰，则变得更为纯粹，即未来证明自身价值，更是为了正在快速进化中的全体人类贡献自己的一份力量。有得必有失，只要得到的更多、收益更大，我们便需要懂得在前进的道路上有所取舍。身处新的环境，是时候迎接新的模式，以及新人文。

## Fully Connected

随着通用互联系统将每个个体、每个集成智能组件、每个外设都联入网络，从而使得所有的一切都能在安全的前提下进入互相瞬息交流和访问，大幅提升协同效率。

这个过程是逐渐建立起来的。起初，在全互联到来之前，电报、电话、互联网相继被发明，并在随后迅速发展；5G 网络普及后更是大幅提升人们手中电子产品和 IoT 的联网可靠性和内容丰富性，带宽、延迟、功能都出现明显的增强。伴随着网络和设备的接入能力越来越普及，人们周边已随处都是能够连入网络的设备，为我们的生活提供便利。这种发展趋势依旧正在持续，无论是网络技术的演进还是接入设备的增多，亦或是基于此之上的功能的更加丰富，都是朝着全互联、全智能的方向发展。

新人类出现后，这种现象就表现得更为激进了。由于集成智能组件是直接接入人身体的，是直接受人脑控制的，而集成智能组件本身又是具备联网能力的，因此其实大脑在思考的时候，其实许多思路、依据、动作，都是经由网络完成的。例如，当大脑在探寻关于弦理论相关方面的知识并作深入研究时，提供记忆功能的集成智能组件，会自动连接至云端知识库，从中检索所需的信息，这时这些知识点就仿佛之前已经阅读学习过一样，复现在脑海之中，亦即前面所提潜在按需注入技术。又例如，当需要购置一套房产时，脑海中便立即会出现现有的合适房源，因为这些信息也如同了解弦理论相关知识一样，能够经由集成智能组件在相关的交易平台上查询到，此时就像我们曾经打开过 app 查找或线下深入探寻过那样，一切了如指掌。再举个例子，当需要在月球上采集一块特定地区的土壤探究其中一些奥秘时，38万千米外的一辆月球车便被大脑通过网络唤起，你就像坐在这辆月球车上一样，甚至你感觉你就是这辆月球车，更确切地说，月球车成为了你的一部分，它的能力、它的感受，完全传输到了你的身上，由你“直接”完成对应操作。

人与人的沟通也是如此，无需聚在一起，却宛如聚在一起，似乎人已经无形。对世界的感知和影响可谓瞬息无影。你似乎原地不动，但却又瞬间出现在需要的地方，甚至出现在任何地方。以至于从某种角度来说，很难再去界定人的真实物理形态。当全互联的模式达到极致时，如果非要说某个人在哪，恐怕以其大脑所在地来描述更为贴切。然而，随着超智域的出现，人脑也完全被多个相对应的集成智能组件所分别承载，这些集成智能组件可以根据需要分散在最合适的不同地方。因此，人的真实物理形态已经不再重要了，也没人会在乎这件事，因为这不会带来太明显的影响，毕竟每个人似乎都已经无处不在了。

此时，沟通交流，在当代人文逐渐转变的过程中，也会出现新的模式。

由于效率和可触达性的大幅提升，以及更底层的直觉传达已经成为现实，再加上人们的主要精神向往更多会是往向前发展的目标来推进，因此人们之间的沟通，在背景知识和交流广度的不断增大的前提下，会越发频发，而其中内容也会越来越丰富。这时，新的沟通艺术便产生了。人们会用更为结构化的方式来表达所描述的事情，目的是为了确保描述的内容更清晰、精准、有效。所谓结构化，就是将索要说的核心内容，以及之间的关联关系，以特定的语法形态来进行描述。与我们目前自然语言相比，其描述规则要比我们现行常规语法要严格严谨的多，以提高表达精确度，和确保双方理解的一致性。这种对话方式在我们现在许多场景可能会显得非常臃肿，但对于海量信息，且关系复杂时，因其自带的这些特性，却是最高效的，因此逐渐成为人们日常沟通的方式，或者说，这是一门新的语言。经过一段时间快速发展，包括 AI 的协助，很快便成为了全球人沟通的通用语言。受大脑知识潜在按需注入的方式，导致人们学习成本极具降低的影响，大家很快便都学会了这门语言，后续的发展也同步更新，中间没有遇到任何障碍。这门语言和沟通的技巧，就像当下通过书籍话剧影视作品的方式产生共鸣那样，便也成了新的艺术、最有效的艺术。

有时候，一门技术的出现，其所带来的影响是惊人的，甚至颠覆另一个行业。例如，本茨和戴姆勒发明出内燃机汽车时，养马、驯马、马队，连同马饲料的生产运输，似乎都被一锅端，古时候的骑兵，后来也变成了机械化部队，现在还能看到的，恐怕只有少数的赛马、表演、古道旅游和高端兴趣学习了。同样，全互联，以及其所产生的新语言，自然也会给世界带来了巨大的革新。

由于大家采用相同的语言和表述方法，原先的语言隔阂从最根源被彻底打通，翻译器似乎成了累赘，也不会存在既然有了翻译器那么不需要统一语言的想法，因为统一语言的动力不在于统一本身，而是一种集体智慧集中化导致的自然演进，这些语言本身就有迅速习来特性，没必要多此一举通过多套系统分别生成不一样的语言。语言的打通，也带来许多文化隔阂的逐渐消失。另外，随着信仰变得更纯粹，当下的宗教也将逐渐消失，或许其核心思想中在未来值得借鉴学习的有用内容会被得以保存，但本质上会作为共同知识的一部分，而不是以独立信仰的形式存在。同理，政治见解和民族风情也是如此，随着相互交流在广度和深度上的提升，人们愈发呈现出意识形态的一致性。如果要说有什么区别，那可能只是分工上的不同，有的人擅长这个，有的人热衷那个，大家以超大社区的形式，共同探索、发现、改进，一起推进整个社会的前行，并产生更多的资源，成为每个人的收获，也是整个社会的收益。

因此，全互联不只是一种沟通加强的手段，更是一种必备技能、一种进化途径、一种生存之道。而有了这一切后，很快新的变革又将产生，超智域在刚出现没多久，又将产生另一个超大型的进化，带来一个更颠覆但又更成熟的现象。

## Intelligent Planet

当人们交流毫无障碍，而想法从整体宏观层面又趋于一致时，本身构造又共享互联，这时其实就出现了一个非常微妙的关系，即这种为了共同目标而自发无形的大型分工，是不是意味着，这个群体，其实并不是一个一个的个体所组成的，而更为激进的，这其实就是一个整体，或者说是一个巨大的独立的个体？里面原本的一个个人，更像是一个个细胞，每个细胞各司其职又互相关联，非常有机地构成了整个人，每个人各尽其能且相互支持，非常有机地构成了一个全新的物种，霸占整个地球和近太空的单一超级智慧型生物——智星球！

要回答这个问题，或者解释这个现象，我们不妨回顾一下，在这样激进的一个进化演变过程中，人们的思考形式和身体形态最终变成了什么样子。

考虑到信息通畅已成为基础，人与人，或者群体之间，可以大规模而又迅速地讨论问题。由于感性的部分越来越少，加上随着语言结构化模式的产生，人们之间的沟通基本以理性为主导，因此对于分歧，基本都已推理和验证为基础来决优劣，或是得出继续深究或讨论终止的结论，而无论结果如何，大家都就事论事，不会因为争论输赢而存在沮丧、气氛或不屑等主观感受，一方面是因为人们的主观感受，受客观环境的升级所致普遍更满意幸福且稳定影响，不太容易出现波动，另一方面是因为大家的讨论事项的目的都是为了得出最有结论，各参会方提供的是各自的数据支撑，大的方向一般都不会存在问题，更多是细节上或角度上略有偏差，也就是说更多的是一些取舍和平衡问题。越往后，随着人们信息源的一致性以及分析能力的共同提升影响，分歧基本不太容易出现，相比之下，大家得出的结论更容易是出奇一致的。如果存在不一致，更有可能是大家分开从不同角度切入问题，最后进行汇总，那么不一样只是因为角度选择分工导致的，与人无关，大家都是站在拟定的角度上提供信息，并群策群力最后完成共同选择。

于是，从更高层次上看，人们的看法总是一致的，没有任何分歧。但为了提高效率，许多事情会由大家分工推进。包括事情与事情之间，也是分组分别推进。最后的结论和收获，都会在相应范围内进行统一汇总，并作为社会整体的共同财富而留存。

而在对事务的具体处理上，包括收集信息、执行动作、更新信息，大家所能调用的资源其实是共享的。例如，当有以为名为 A 的人需要增添一个被套，那么他需要先知道自己卧室的床的尺寸，然后去购物平台进行选择和下单购买，等待收获后便可从包裹中拿出来使用。在新人类及以后的时代里，A 只需用其大脑经集成智能组件操控调用远程连接的机器人前去测量尺寸，或是从以往订单中读取床本身的尺寸，接下来就可以遍历筛选待售床单列表，挑选最合适的，卖家 C 便会安排出货送货。而实际上，这个过程其实更灵活。也许 A 委托另一人（例如他的亲戚）B 来帮忙完成这些事，B 在获取到 A 的授权后，可以直接执行原本 A 经历的过程，包括操纵 A 的机器人或读取其对应的订单信息，而在完成订单后，如果愿意，B 在获得 C 授予相应控制权后，甚至能自行控制库房里的机械臂和传输带，将下单的床单放入快递车内，并还能直接控制快递车来运送货物。当然，这个场景在彼时并不会发生，因为那时不需要购买床单，更不需要开车技能，智能化和自动化会帮助搞定一切简单繁琐的事务。但这种行为模式在那时是存在的。只要获得所有者的授权，那么便可以访问对应的资源，包括操控工具、感知情况、翻阅信息等。不过更确切地说，其实大多这些资源都不会有个人所有者，而都是集体所有，然后再通过责任划分和系统管理的方式，授权划分给不同人进行管理，这些人对这些资源有时也具有更具体权限的授予权力，从而以共享的形式实现更灵活的资源利用，随时随地物尽其用却又安全受控。

因此，人们思考是具有一致性和协作性的，对资源也是建立在共享和安全的基础上的。其中前者进一步带来心有灵犀，而后者进一步带来彼此不分。这种在精神和物质层面上高度的统一和谐，进一步导致大家其实进入高度融合的状态，你的就是我的，你想的也正是我想的，反之亦然，仿佛我和你之间没有了界限，思想合一、形态合一、意志合一，就是一个人。不，确切的说，是大家全部都是一个人。人与人之间，就像前面所言，更像是一个有机体中不同组成部分的关系那样，通力紧密分工合作，不再以个体形式做分割。从此，全球所有人，连同接入的集成智能组件及其外设，以一个整体的形态，形成了一个更高阶、更完善、更全能的超级智慧有机体。

在这个进程中，在地球上全体人类合众为一的过程中，自然生态也发生着巨大的变化。在以往的进化过程中，大量的生物诞生，为适者生存创造了足够的基数用于向前演进。在这个演进过程中，一些生物学会了在整体环境之上，创造更有利于自己生存的微观环境，例如鸟会筑巢、蛇会钻洞、蜜蜂会造蜂巢，当代的人类，也通过搭建公路房屋、新建城市，创造出自己的品质生活。

随着工业发展，污染成了顽疾，与其说着破坏了地球，不如说这破坏了适合人类生活的环境，毕竟就地球本身而言这些排污根本不值一提，没什么能对星球造成的重大影响。1952年伦敦一场雾霾，当月致死4000人，当人们开始意识到问题的严重，便开始着手环境治理，通过多种手段倡导对生态的保护。花费这么大的精力来进行改善，其本质还是让人类生存环境变得更好。虽然现在人们依旧在谈论保护地球给种动植物，但在真正面对人类需要时，肯定还是以人类生存为主，基于此在看如何改善这么做的副作用。例如，兴修水利工程，既治水，又发电，利于千秋万代。为此，围山造水库，截水建大坝。如此大规模人造工程，显然对当地原始自然环境造成极大影响。下游的鱼因此无法往上游游，人们便人工助其跨越水坝。但水利工程能不修吗？不行。其能带来的清洁能源和旱涝调控，可谓意义深远重大，必须要修。就像高速驰骋路上，突然窜出一只小猫，能避开最好，但不能的话，也绝不能贸然做出诸如紧急变道等过激行为，从而对车内其他在座人员，以及周围车辆的安全不顾。

随着时间的后移，人们进化成更高阶的物种后，一方面对地球资源的开发也会更重，另一方面现有的地球环境在彼时未必是最好的。因此，越来越多类似水利工程的项目登场。为了给大规模服务器集群降温，我们需要大量水资源，而海水在短时间内取之不尽、用之不竭，因此在技术可行后可以引入。然而海水中的盐碱物质对一些导热物体具有腐蚀性，海洋生物的附着更是会降低散热效果，因此很快便会针对附近海水进行纯净化过滤。随着海洋服务器集群的大规模投入使用，海洋也逐渐被填满，海洋生物也岌岌可危。然而，没有这些服务器集群，彼时的人类可能无法生存，就像现在如果把我们全部放回巨大的野生环境中，并且不提供任何工具和淡水，恐怕我们的存活率也会面临巨大压力。最终，地球的模样已于现在完全不同，全球基本都被新型单一物种所覆盖，包括陆地、海洋、天空、近地空间内在的各项地球上的资源，正以前所未有的速度被开发利用。其他物种在此过程中相继消亡，没有人想去主动灭绝他们，但他们在新的时代中被彻底淘汰了。

最终，智星球成了地球上唯一的生物，而且以整个地球的形态存在，连同附近太空和更远处的航天飞行器，都是其中一部分。

## Postscript

在人类尚未进化成新人类的时候，太空探索已经进行了很多年。初期象征意义相对更大，但也有许多成效，只不过和后期相比自然是微不足道的。任何事物的发展都是如此，从新生到产生巨大意义需要时间的考研。现代天气预报依托包括卫星在内的众多手段实现，每年能帮助农业避免许多损失。太空探索能大大丰富我们对事物的了解和对资源的采集，所以必须继续。待到超智域到来时，人们已达成不凡的成效。彼时，大型星舰已能四处穿梭，承载着母星下发的庄重任务与崇高使命，遨游太空，奔赴星辰大海，创造一个又一个的奇迹。

随着物理距离的不断拉大，即便拥有更先进的技术实现超高速乃至接近光速的旅行，但这也只是增大我们探索的范围，就像现如今有了飞机，然而东半球飞到西半球依旧需要十几个小时，消耗了大半天的功夫，只是说在相同时间里走的路程远远比以往多得多。这已然是个巨大进步，然而就类似时长的更原距离的迅速连通问题，依旧存在。或许，诸如量子纠缠技术能解决这类问题，但这个涉及基础物理概念，其可行性还不确定，因此结论现在不好说。

假设能够解决并能大规模应用这种星际通信机制，那么智星球很快会演变成为智星系：任何适合扩张的星球或星际空间，都会被加以改造变成智星分部，并与其他各智星分部联成一片，以类似当年众人合一变成智星球的模式一样，众智星球合为一个生命体。无论他们分别在哪，无论因地制宜构造他们的结构有多少差异，只要能确保高通路瞬息通信即可。

尚若通信问题无法很好解决，也就是说，无法实现超远距离瞬息联通，或者能实现但无法量产，从而不能创造高通路信号传输线路，那么：智星球会作为更高优先级进行发展；同时同步发展附近星球，先以近处为主，尽可能以能瞬息高通路联通以行程智星系为优；实在偏远的，则尽量保持互联，只不过由于交流受限，天长日久若仍不能解决，终究会出现思维分化，分别身处各自环境而站在各自立场考虑问题和执行任务。这样远处的智星球，与地球之间，更像是亲兄弟的关系。当然，随着技术进步，相信最终还是会再度团结，由近及远，变成大一统智星系。

至于更往以后，生命形态是否会脱离物质形态，成为超自然意识流？这个就不在此展开。而且，如果真是如此，恐怕这种形态也不再适合称之为生命了，而是一种比生命并列但更高级的一种形态吧。或许，到时又会有一篇名为《后智星系》的文章，先是致敬乐观、积极、聪慧的后智星，以及匆匆回顾过往，然后便是泛泛而谈，探讨更未来的篇章。

而当下，让我们奋勇直前，保持乐观的心态，通过积极的努力，展现聪慧的能力，创造下一个灿烂明天！
