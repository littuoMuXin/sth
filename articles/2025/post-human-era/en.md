# Post-Human Era

To optimistic, positive, and intelligent humans!

## Preface

Humans, with the Latin scientific name homo sapiens, are the only known species possessing high intelligence, complex social structures, and advanced cultural development. We have existed on this blue marble of a planet for over 200,000 years, and today about 8 billion people are spread across the globe.

When the first golden rays of sunlight slip through the gaps between tall buildings or the greenery of residential courtyards into your room, you may still recall how, in childhood essays or comics, the red sun was always described as rising from behind distant mountains. Such scenes were easy to encounter in ancient times; nowadays, you need to go to the countryside to truly experience them. With the accelerating pace of urbanization, we have grown accustomed to living in environments reshaped and optimized by human hands. Perhaps it is a hurried hot breakfast in the morning, a cup of coffee or milk tea in the afternoon, and scrolling on your phone until you fall asleep at night—this is the everyday life we take for granted. The bustling traffic, neon lights, clinking of tableware, and endless chatter about work gossip and history surround us daily, becoming ordinary and familiar. Yet this lifestyle is not something that has existed since antiquity; it only appeared recently, though we live in it as naturally as if it were a law of physics that had always been there. This is a snapshot of human social progress to date, a reality we all feel, a phenomenon that emerged only recently despite humanity’s long evolutionary history. And this transformation is still continuing, with no end in sight.

Humans, after all, are products of nature. Our birth, development, and progress all follow natural laws. By adhering to these laws, we gain insights that guide how we advance further. Sustainable development was proposed in this context. Humanity now exerts a powerful influence on other species on this planet—resilient yet fragile. Earth, as the home of humans and countless other living beings, requires careful stewardship. To protect the Earth is, in fact, to protect the environment most suitable for human survival today.

As we exploit the natural world, we also regulate the methods and means of exploitation to ensure that the damage we cause remains controllable. This way, our actions are not short-sighted but can meet present needs while ensuring a thriving future. To achieve this goal, people have established many rules and vigorously developed science and technology, creating more sustainable production techniques. These advances drive progress in health, environment, culture, and convenience, allowing life to move forward continuously.

## Up to Now

In the vast history of 3.5 billion years, life on Earth has thrived endlessly. From the earliest bacteria discovered near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, to organisms that developed photosynthesis and gradually spread to shallow seas and land, and eventually to the emergence of animals—biodiversity has grown richer and richer, with over a million species now recorded. During this time, the development of animals—whether invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, or mammals—has been unstoppable.

Although we may not always perceive evolution happening around us, when we expand the timescale of observation, it becomes clear that the pace of evolution seems to be accelerating.

Fish first appeared about 410 million years ago in the Ordovician period, dinosaurs emerged around 240 million years ago in the Middle Triassic, and the earliest mammals appeared around the same time. These species are separated by vast spans of time, measured in hundreds of millions of years, with countless species arising and disappearing before reaching today. From this perspective, human history is extremely short. Homo sapiens appeared about 250,000 years ago, most of which we call early humans (archaic humans). Late humans (modern humans) only appeared about 50,000 years ago, and what we now call “modern humans” refers to those of the last 10,000 years.

Like dinosaurs, humans can be considered the dominant species of their era. Yet dinosaurs, despite surviving for 170 million years, never evolved into highly intelligent beings. Much of their waking time was consumed by feeding, with no large-scale agriculture or industry. In contrast, humans, with larger and more complex brains, invented and manufactured tools that freed them from mere subsistence, allowing more time to create advanced and practical tools to further improve life. This virtuous cycle included producing tools to make other tools, enhancing our ability to acquire resources in bulk. All of this stems from intelligence.

Upgrades in intelligence brought overwhelming advantages to the species. Even small increases yielded significant improvements. For example, once hunting tools were invented and widely used, humans gained crushing dominance over other animals. Early humans, through this skill and their growing ability for organized cooperation, caused many species to go extinct. As knowledge accumulated and new technologies were invented, efficiency improved, reducing pressures in many areas. The invention of trains and airplanes made the world feel smaller and more accessible. These advantages became increasingly obvious, and the pace of new capabilities accelerated.

From this perspective, compared to the slow pace of biological evolution through mutation, the enhancement of intelligence—and the resulting improvements in ability—has had far more significant impacts. If we treat this growth in intelligence as a form of evolution, and combine it with the timeline above, it is clear that evolution is accelerating.

Early Earth’s harsh environment, through chemical reactions, accidentally created organic matter and gave rise to life. Some organic molecules combined, and against astronomical odds, the first cell was born. Later, multicellular organisms emerged. As time went on, plants and animals diverged, experimenting with survival strategies in their environments and forming the earliest ecosystems. Species adapted and evolved, with intelligence gradually emerging among animals. Once intelligent beings proved successful in nature’s grand experiment, this path became unstoppable—like an arrow released from a bow. This direction of evolution was both accidental and inevitable, each step building upon the last, producing increasingly significant results. That is why evolution has become faster and more profound.

This acceleration mirrors the rapid progress of human culture and technology. The Code of Hammurabi in Babylon was issued around 1776 BCE, the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt was built around 2580 BCE, and the Yellow Emperor defeated Chiyou to become ruler around 2698 BCE. In the 5,000–6,000 years of human civilization, development has been continuous, with many leaps forward. Yet the major breakthroughs in productivity only began less than 300 years ago, and they came one after another: the First Industrial Revolution in the 18th century in Britain, when machines replaced hand tools; the Second Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, when the world entered the “Age of Electricity”; and the Third Industrial Revolution in the mid-20th century, marked by new scientific and technological advances.

In other words, much of the material and spiritual wealth we enjoy today only appeared or was improved very recently. The battlefield mobile telephone created by Bell Labs in 1940 was perhaps the earliest mobile phone; Apple’s first iPhone was released in January 2007, using 2G networks and a single 2-megapixel rear camera—by today’s standards, almost unusable. Reality is like this: we are immersed in the prosperity brought by modern science and technology, yet forget that this timespan is actually very short.

The development of all things seems to follow a J-shaped curve: flat at first, then steeply rising.

Today, in 2025, time flies through our fingers. The world around us seems calm and steady, yet sudden leaps forward happen unexpectedly. Daily life feels peaceful, but explosive progress surrounds us. Compared to the past, this pace is unimaginable. We are now living in the fastest era of technological advancement in history—and the future will only be faster. Humanity has stood at crossroads many times, but we can only keep moving forward, toward the stars and the sea, toward higher civilization.

## AI

In 2012, Google’s self-driving car obtained the first autonomous vehicle license in the United States. More than a decade later, it seems almost embarrassing for a car manufacturer not to have at least Level 2 autonomy. Artificial intelligence, once the subject of people’s hopes and imagination, has now entered households in a surprisingly short time.

In 2017, at a Go match in Wuzhen, Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated human world champion Ke Jie by 3–0. By the end of 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, representing generative pre-trained AI, swept across the globe. Soon after, DeepSeek emerged, introducing a mixture-of-experts architecture that reduced training costs. The AI race has become a flourishing field, with countless models competing and innovating at breathtaking speed.

Looking back at this rapidly accelerating timeline of technological progress, we have reason to believe that as time goes on, richer, more advanced, and bolder innovations and applications will appear at ever higher frequencies.

This phenomenon is easy to explain: imagine starting with only a few coins in your pocket, trying to build a business from scratch. The effort and luck required are immense. But once you reach an initial scale, replicating and improving becomes faster, thanks to experience and resources. As development continues, profits multiply, expansion accelerates, and new methods are adopted to grow horizontally and vertically. Eventually, globalization, diversification, and ecosystem building bring new opportunities.

When growth reaches a plateau, does Moore’s Law fail and everything stagnate? Not necessarily. Walmart seemed to hit the ceiling of retail, but soon Amazon and Tmall showed that e-commerce was a whole new level above. Similarly, Intel’s CPUs faced criticism for slowing performance gains, but GPUs and NPUs opened new paths for rapid progress. What looks like a limit often becomes the threshold for a new qualitative leap.

Technological development follows this pattern. Past knowledge provides both a solid foundation and practical tools for new directions. Standing on the shoulders of giants, we can produce more high-quality results in less time. This cascading evolution resembles a chain reaction—like the instant an atomic bomb ignites.

From knotted ropes to counting rods, abacuses, and slide rules, humans invented tools to simplify calculation. These tools freed us from tedious arithmetic, enabling faster and more accurate work in finance, construction, and statistics. They also laid the groundwork for designing new computing tools. In 1940, Alan Turing invented the Bombe to crack German Enigma codes; in 1946, the first generation of computers—vacuum tube digital machines—was born. After three generations of development, we arrived at today’s large-scale integrated circuit computers. Now, we use computers to design new computers, iterating generation after generation. This cascading evolution produces ever greater efficiency and value.

Artificial intelligence is part of this same background and subject to the same laws. Remarkably, AI is still in its early stages, yet progress has already been astonishing, with future potential beyond imagination. From Microsoft’s Cortana and early versions of Apple’s Siri to today’s Microsoft Copilot series and diverse intelligent agents, we have witnessed a dazzling transformation. These agents can compose poetry, create art, write essays, make videos, generate code, edit presentations, introduce knowledge, summarize information, give recommendations, and execute tasks. They serve both entertainment and productivity, becoming indispensable assistants in life, study, and work.

AI’s impact on industries is profound—benefiting many while disrupting others, even threatening to reshape future development models. Yet limitations remain: high operating costs, restricted input/output, and limited capability ranges. But as technology advances, models will evolve. Future systems may achieve today’s results with far less computing power, while hardware improvements and capital investment will provide more resources. When new foundational architectures emerge, intelligent agents will rise to a new level. At that point, today’s systems may be considered “primitive”, mere early-stage AI. And given the current pace of progress, that future is not far away—perhaps only a few years ahead.

## Intersection

“Faster, Higher, Stronger—Together”. As is well known, this is the Olympic motto. The fearless spirit of moving forward, daring to struggle, daring to win, never being satisfied, constantly overcoming and surpassing oneself to reach new goals and new realms—this is not only the ethos of competition, but also the everyday style of humanity.

Throughout the long river of human history, as production methods and other aspects advanced, we have often faced confusion and uncertainty. Yet in the end, we always moved toward brighter times. For example, during the First Industrial Revolution, machines replaced manual labor, leading to widespread unemployment and wage decline. Some workers saw machines as the root of poverty, and the Luddite movement emerged—workers destroyed machines to resist oppression and exploitation. But history rolled forward. Once employment security issues were resolved, large-scale industry became factory-based, assembly-line, and mechanized. Later, automation and intelligence were introduced. Every transformation brought pain, but soon new vitality sprouted, influencing all aspects of life.

Over the past two centuries, with the development of physics, chemistry, and biology, life sciences and medicine entered the track of scientific progress. Many radical treatments and supportive methods appeared, unimaginable in ancient times. For example, vaccines gave humanity proactive means to fight disease; MRI allowed doctors to examine internal organs and lesions with unprecedented clarity. With more advanced technologies, medicine provided stronger protection for human health, and some may eventually expand into new capabilities.

Prosthetics were originally designed to help disabled individuals live closer to normal lives. With the advent of brain–computer interfaces, though still limited in practicality today, we can expect that in the future, combining prosthetics with such interfaces will allow disabled people to achieve equal or even superior abilities compared to ordinary humans. Advanced mechanical structures, motors, and sensors could give prosthetics stronger performance and richer functions—for instance, bionic feet designed for enhanced jumping, or mechanical grips added to feet for tasks beyond walking. Maintenance and replacement would be simpler, making them potentially superior to natural limbs. With brain–computer interfaces transmitting human intent directly, not just sensing motion trends, these prosthetics could perform tasks more smoothly and precisely.

This expansion need not be limited to prosthetics. Exoskeletons and other external devices could be applied to healthy individuals as well, functioning like computer peripherals. With such support, commands and feedback could be transmitted via brain–computer interfaces, motion sensing, and AI prediction, enabling humans to perform abilities they never had before—without relying on keyboards or voice commands.

One day, as more powerful external devices are designed, natural limbs and organs may be used less frequently and gradually degenerate. Degeneration is not always frightening—the appendix is a typical example today. In the future, with technological support, more body parts and organs may degenerate, blurring the line between external devices and prosthetics.

Animals rely on instinct to survive and reproduce. These instincts are the result of centuries of selection and accumulation. Humans, however, have adjusted their environment on a massive scale to better suit collective survival. In this new environment, with new social relations and lifestyles, rationality became more important than instinct—for example, not panicking in emergencies. Rationality itself is a kind of evolution, enabling us to solve problems at a higher level. With rapid technological progress, adopting intelligent external devices is another higher-level evolutionary path, achieving effects that physical evolution alone cannot. These devices replace bodily functions just as rationality sometimes replaces instinct.

This process will bring doubt and opposition, just like the Industrial Revolution. People will stand at crossroads, weighing pros and cons. Yet after hesitation, society will gradually accept this trend, embracing a new model that creates infinite possibilities for future life. Intelligent external devices will gradually replace parts of our bodies, becoming part of us—making us faster, higher, stronger, and eventually, more united.

## Integration

As people adopt more and more intelligent external devices, and as these devices increasingly replace our original abilities, our dependence on them grows stronger. Eventually, we may choose to equip different types of devices according to our needs, but overall, these external aids will become indispensable parts of our bodies. At that point, calling them “external devices” may no longer be appropriate—“integrated intelligent components” would be a better term. After all, only by integrating them can we become complete, capable beings; without them, we would lose many abilities and struggle to survive.

These integrated intelligent components will be designed to ever higher standards, capable of replacing more and more of our natural functions. For example, new artificial eyes may surpass human vision with higher resolution, faster frame rates, wider color ranges, optical zoom, and even infrared perception. Integrated algorithms could help us focus on objects of interest, automatically supplement information, and search for items—like augmented reality, but more advanced and directly built into our bodies. Such components could be installed throughout our bodies, assisting both perception and action.

Behind all this lies an even more important force: AI. After long periods of rapid development, new generations of AI—far beyond today’s heuristic systems—will permeate every aspect of life, helping us achieve everything. AI will not only support specific tasks or entertainment, but also guide how we improve the very processes of progress. Integrated into intelligent components, AI will allow our brains to issue minimal instructions yet achieve rich, precise results. Moreover, the engineering design of these systems will itself be carried out by AI, which will also drive their continual evolution. Over time, AI will require less human intervention, self-improving like AlphaGo once did through self-play in Go.

Integration will transform our physical form, our way of thinking, and our way of living. At that point, are we still animals, still humans?

One could say yes. Even if many parts are replaced, our essence remains human flesh. Our will still originates in the brain, our blood still flows thanks to the heart. Though we cannot survive independently without these components, it is still humans who created and connected them, and they revolve around our ideas. From this perspective, we remain human, still animals.

But one could also say no. With AI augmentation and integrated components, our thinking changes drastically. Many body parts may be replaced, even the heart itself, and nutrition may be delivered through new, more efficient methods. These changes alter our priorities and pursuits. What we now consider vital—like health—may no longer be central, or may be redefined. From this perspective, we are no longer human, perhaps not even animals.

Whether we are “still human” may not matter much outside taxonomy. Yet we can set a definition: humanity becomes a new species when the proportion of replaced functions—especially core organs and brain processes—reaches a certain threshold. At that point, humans evolve into “new humans”, a new species born through artificial and AI-driven evolution. Importantly, since AI is itself a human creation, this process remains part of nature—though “nature” here refers to a broader sense than before.

With this transformation, lifestyles and aspirations will change dramatically. People will focus more on upgrading components, since these directly enhance personal abilities—like today’s pursuit of phones, bags, or cars, but far more impactful. As material needs are easily met, attention will shift to spiritual goals. Ultimately, these goals will center on long-term, high-quality enjoyment and affirmation of self-worth. Enjoyment means luxurious, carefree living; affirmation means proving one’s existence and answering the ultimate question: why do I live? In this future, advancing the evolution of all “new humans” will be the highest way to affirm self-worth.

In the end, the only real question is how to define the threshold of replacement. But regardless of the exact definition, a new species will emerge. And even this “new human” will be transitional—like Australopithecus before modern humans—destined to be replaced by even more advanced forms.

## New Domain

Evolution is still ongoing—and accelerating.

Indeed, for the “new human”, evolution is realized through the replacement of biological functions with integrated intelligent systems. Human bodily functions further degenerate, while intelligent agents expand in breadth and depth, covering more capabilities and applications at a rapid pace. From the moment of birth, individuals are already connected to sufficiently rich intelligent systems; moreover, through drugs and other means such as genetic editing, the growth of original biological functions is suppressed. Perhaps even the very definition of “birth” will change, and the word itself may acquire a new meaning.

Our decision-making brain also undergoes profound changes and challenges. Integrated intelligent components bring entirely new sensory and motor abilities, reshaping the way the brain thinks. Yet the greatest impact comes from another category of integrated intelligent components specifically designed to assist brain cognition.

Our brains store many memories, but we cannot remember everything. As knowledge explodes, the world becomes overwhelmingly dynamic, and our perceptual and action capabilities expand, the amount of information we encounter grows exponentially. Some of this information isn’t that important, so forgetting it is fine. Yet, we can't always know which information and knowledge points might be useful and need to be recalled at any time. But our brain capacity is limited. Fortunately, the brain can access integrated intelligent components for additional storage, which have enormous capacity and extremely efficient storing and retrieval speeds. Our original memory quality becomes less critical. What's even more impressive is that through the cloud, public information can be shared—such as ready-made knowledge points and events that have already happened—which seems to become part of our brains. When we try to access this information, the integrated intelligent storage component retrieves it via the cloud and delivers it directly to our brain as if it were a memory. This means it seems we no longer need to study. This ultimate skill is a daydream for many modern people; there’s no need to drink knowledge shakes, use plug-in devices, or transfer data via cables. Information is available whenever we want, updated in real-time, seemingly unbeatable. This technology is called potential on-demand injection technology.

Therefore, if you still have reservations about moving toward the development of integrated intelligent components, now that you can have this skill, you are probably starting to consider supporting this direction, right? In fact, this is just a small example, and such advantages will be ubiquitous. Storage can be expanded, and brain computing power even more so: spatial imagination, logical reasoning ability, and judgment can be supported by integrated intelligent components designed for high-performance computing, and on top of that, artificial intelligence can help you think and provide answers, making humans almost all geniuses. This ability is innate.

One point that must be mentioned here is that this ability expansion is not optional; it is essential. As the human body connects to more and more integrated intelligent components, and each component itself becomes very powerful, even though AI will help streamline and extract input information and automatically expand output commands, the original human brain can no longer handle this massive information processing, nor will it have the time or opportunity to 'naturally' evolve to accommodate these additional capabilities. Whether it is perception and understanding or driving and controlling, the brain will become a bottleneck. For example, new types of eyes can allow us to perceive a wider color spectrum, larger and more detailed images, stronger depth perception, and supplement related descriptions in a structured way within the image. This information is too rich; even selecting the key points is beyond what our current brains can handle. Similarly, the 'legs' and 'feet' we control can accomplish far more than we might imagine because these 'legs and feet' are no longer just traditional limbs. In addition to walking, running, and kicking, our vehicles, in the form of external devices—similar to the relationship between a computer and a Bluetooth mouse—are integrated with our 'legs,' allowing us to directly control them like driving a car or flying at low altitudes, constantly sensing various feedback during the process, just as when walking we can feel whether the ground is flat under our 'feet.' Therefore, expanding brain capabilities is imperative to lighten its burden and enable us to perform any decision we want more excellently, accurately, and quickly.

It is foreseeable that many of the brain's original functions will deteriorate and be replaced, let alone other parts of the body. This may seem incredible, but whether from the perspective of necessity or requirement, this is an evolutionary direction. This direction can make everyone unprecedentedly powerful, just as we can no longer accept living like monkeys running around in the forest all day, and monkeys might find it hard to imagine not living and foraging in the forest in the future, so what should they do? Of course, everyone will adapt. As urban development encroaches on nature, many animals have been forced to accept the form of the habitats we have created and even become dependent on them. Nowadays, pet cats and dogs, under human care, have even lost the basic survival skills they had in the wild and live comfortably and happily in human homes. If this applies to animals, considering the advantages brought by new forms, humans accepting and adapting to a better, improved environment is even easier.

The vast majority of the human body has already been replaced by integrated intelligent components, until eventually it is entirely updated and replaced. Integrated intelligent components are mainly composed of organic molecular materials and advanced composite materials, so they cannot simply be considered machines. Whether they are carbon-based or not depends on the materials science of the time, as well as the corresponding manufacturing processes and designs, but they are no longer man-made objects; instead, they are fully AI-designed and organized for production and deployment. Of course, many of these components also contain advanced computing units and intelligent models built in, which allow them to spontaneously make detailed judgments and adaptive command adjustments during perception and execution, much like our current knee-jerk reflexes or muscle memory. However, based on AI, they are more intelligent, even surpassing the intelligence of our current brains, thus enabling better information acquisition and task completion. These components gradually replace the body's original parts through expansion, integration, and fusion, fundamentally transforming the composition and lifestyle of humans and the subsequently evolved post-humans, creating a new form of life.

At the same time, if biologists still exist at that point, they would begin to consider that these species are completely different from those of the past. The proportion of integrated intelligent components in the human body has shifted from being a part of post-humans to being almost or entirely complete. Because the coverage of integrated intelligent components is higher, and after some time, AI capabilities evolve to a higher level, the intelligence and abilities of contemporary species are significantly greater. Since their forms have become extremely radical, it is necessary to distinguish them from a higher level, which should actually be the highest biological taxonomy level, resulting in a new domain. A new ultra-intelligent domain has branched out from the eukaryotic domain of the animal kingdom, signifying super-intelligence. It is no longer named based on biological form or composition, because that is inadequate to reflect its characteristics; the intelligence far surpassing previous forms is the defining feature. Depending on whether any of the original human parts are still retained, this domain is further divided into the quasi-ultra-intelligent domain and the full ultra-intelligent domain, in chronological order. The evolutionary process of these two phyla is far faster than any previous types, taking less than a year in some cases.

Currently, biologists have established a biological classification system to distinguish species, which is a hierarchical classification system based on similarity. From top to bottom, it includes domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. For convenience, the term “human” or “people” will still be used to refer to the newly evolved species from this stage of evolution.

## Humanism

As the post-human era continues to advance along the timeline, not only have the forms of humans themselves and their surrounding environment undergone tremendous changes, but the way people think has also undergone a drastic transformation, leading to irreversible innovations in various cultural fields such as literature, communication, art, entertainment, sports, tourism, and belief.

Throughout human history, cultural domains emerged gradually with the birth of civilization and were continuously enriched and expanded. This process has seen multiple iterations and updates over time. Influenced by differences in geography and ethnicity, shaped by varying conditions and developmental paths, diversity gradually appeared. These diverse cultures, through exchanges among people, have also experienced a certain degree of integration and co-development. Today, inclusive and diverse cultural hues have become the colors of the global village—embracing strengths, tolerating differences, and evolving continuously.

Since the emergence of “new humans”, this pace of development has accelerated dramatically, as if the accelerator pedal has been pressed.

Supported by advanced integrated intelligent components, communication among people has become simpler and more efficient: no longer do individuals need to pick up a phone to call or text; instead, interaction is far more direct because these components are networked and inherently equipped with communication capabilities. Based on this, what A wants to express can be projected directly into B’s mind through the feedback functions of their integrated intelligent components.

One day, A is attending an art exhibition filled with stunning oil paintings. A wants to share this experience—especially the feelings of the moment—with friend B. Today, we might use a video call, streaming the scene through a limited-pixel camera and a small screen, supplemented by animated verbal descriptions to convey the atmosphere. While rich, the overall effect remains compromised. “New humans” and later “ultra-intelligent domain humans” have a far superior method. As A tours the gallery, the complete imagery captured by A’s enhanced vision, along with selected auxiliary data, can be streamed directly to B. B experiences it as vividly as if seeing it firsthand. Meanwhile, A’s voice content is transmitted directly to B’s auditory system via the network—though A never actually speaks aloud. Everything is routed through A’s audio-output integrated component (our traditional “throat”), sending sound to B’s auditory component (our traditional “ear”). This audio can include speech or any other sound A wishes to produce—music, for example—thanks to a new “throat” equipped with an entire suite of instruments, audio samples, and effects, all as effortlessly controlled as ordinary speech today. Conversely, B responds similarly, even annotating A’s shared visuals and sending them back. The entire exchange is simple, efficient, and clear. Behind the scenes, robust content-sharing controls and recognition systems prevent unwanted information from being transmitted and filter out irrelevant input, complemented by real-time AI summarization and assistance. Communication thus becomes advanced and intuitive.

As communication undergoes this revolution, literature, art, and entertainment are transformed as well. Historically, music, chess, calligraphy, painting, poetry, prose, dance, drama, film, and comics—all aimed to tell stories artistically to evoke resonance or describe phenomena to impart knowledge. Appreciating such works often led us to interpret the creator’s intent and sometimes inspired deeper reflection. These elegant methods of information transfer relied on expressive techniques and aesthetic enhancement to amplify emotional impact, offering joy, sorrow, excitement, contemplation—rich and interwoven feelings that nourished the soul. With new communication modes, this form of emotional transmission seems poised for a more direct approach. People can share raw experiences, as in the gallery example; transmit thoughts with crystal-clear audio and diverse sound forms; and even convey basic sensations like heartbeat, temperature, and breath.

Yet such scenarios may rarely occur. By then, aided by advanced integrated intelligent components, people will have already explored all wonders and masterpieces, accessing vast knowledge on demand. Physical travel will vanish, as external devices can substitute for the body when needed. Comfortable, convenient living eliminates worries; seamless communication minimizes conflict, making anger rare. As perfection prevails, rationality dominates, emotional influence wanes, and efficiency and scientific judgment rise. Ultimately, emotions stabilize, maintaining consistent happiness. Life’s primary goal becomes affirming personal value, with emotional expression reduced to showcasing achievements. Emotional transmission nearly disappears, replaced by sharing research breakthroughs to enrich collective knowledge and resources—while demonstrating individual worth.
Sports, likewise, fade away. Human physical functions are supplanted by advanced engineering and intelligent technologies. Integrated components deliver optimal performance with simple repair and replacement options. Considering remote-control capabilities, people can operate distant or physically separated peripherals without intermediaries like keyboards or joysticks. Instead, the brain interfaces directly with devices through a universal neural interconnection system, enabling intuitive, efficient control and perception. Health becomes perpetual and ideal, rendering traditional sports obsolete.

Thus, communication grows more direct—entirely new and highly efficient. Literature, art, sports, entertainment, and tourism, once core cultural pillars, gradually disappear in subsequent evolution. Regrettable, perhaps, but not tragic: they leave behind immense spiritual wealth, their mission complete. They do not vanish entirely but reemerge in new forms, creating even greater value. Belief becomes purer—focused on proving one’s worth and contributing to humanity’s rapid evolution. Gains require sacrifices; as long as benefits outweigh losses, we must learn to choose wisely on the path forward. In this new environment, it is time to embrace new models and a new humanism.

## Full Interconnection

As the universal interconnected system integrates every individual, every intelligent component, and every peripheral into the network, everything can interact and access each other instantly and securely, significantly enhancing collaborative efficiency.

This process was built gradually. Initially, before full interconnection arrived, the telegraph, telephone, and the internet were invented and rapidly developed; after the widespread adoption of 5G networks, the reliability and richness of connectivity for electronic devices and IoT improved dramatically, with noticeable enhancements in bandwidth, latency, and functionality. As network technology evolved and access devices proliferated, network-enabled devices became ubiquitous, providing convenience in daily life. This trend continues: whether through advances in networking, the increase in connected devices, or the growing richness of functions built on these foundations, everything is moving toward full interconnection and universal intelligence.

After the emergence of “new humans”, this phenomenon became far more radical. Integrated intelligent components are directly embedded in the human body and controlled by the brain, while these components themselves possess networking capabilities. Thus, when the brain is thinking, many ideas, references, and actions are executed via the network. For example, when the brain explores knowledge related to string theory for deep research, memory-supporting integrated intelligent components automatically connect to cloud knowledge bases to retrieve the required information, making these concepts appear as if they had already been studied—an application of the previously mentioned on-demand injection technology. Similarly, when purchasing real estate, suitable listings instantly appear in the mind because integrated intelligent components query relevant platforms, just as if one had previously browsed apps or conducted offline searches. Another example: when collecting soil samples from a specific lunar region to uncover its secrets, a rover 380,000 kilometers away is activated by the brain through the network. You feel as though you are sitting in the rover—or more precisely, the rover becomes part of you. Its capabilities and sensory feedback are fully transmitted to you, enabling you to perform operations “directly”.

Human communication follows the same principle: no need to gather physically, yet it feels as if everyone is together—human presence becomes almost intangible. Perception and influence on the world occur instantaneously and invisibly. You seem stationary, yet you appear wherever needed, even everywhere at once. From some perspectives, defining a person’s physical form becomes nearly impossible. When full interconnection reaches its peak, if one must specify where someone is, describing the location of their brain might be most accurate. However, with the advent of the ultra-intelligent domain, the brain itself is distributed across multiple integrated intelligent components placed in optimal locations as needed. Physical form ceases to matter, and no one cares, because it makes little difference—everyone seems omnipresent.

At this stage, communication evolves into new modes as contemporary human culture transforms.

With dramatic improvements in efficiency and reach, combined with the realization of deep intuitive transmission, and as humanity’s aspirations increasingly focus on forward progress, communication becomes more frequent and richer in content, supported by expanding background knowledge and breadth of exchange. A new communication art emerges: people express ideas in more structured ways to ensure clarity, precision, and effectiveness. “Structured” means describing core content and relationships using specific syntactic forms. Compared to current natural language, these rules are far stricter to improve accuracy and guarantee mutual understanding. While such dialogue might seem cumbersome today, for massive, complex information, its inherent advantages make it the most efficient method—eventually becoming the standard mode of communication, or rather, a new language. Rapid development, aided by AI, soon makes it the universal language of humanity. Thanks to on-demand knowledge injection, learning costs plummet, enabling everyone to master this language quickly, with updates occurring seamlessly. This language and its communicative techniques become a new art form—the most effective art—akin to how books, theater, and film once evoked resonance.

Sometimes, a single technology brings astonishing, industry-shaking impact. When Benz and Daimler invented the internal combustion automobile, horse breeding, training, and feed production were swept away; cavalry gave way to mechanized forces, leaving only niche pursuits like racing, performance, heritage tourism, and elite hobbies. Similarly, full interconnection and its resulting new language will revolutionize the world.

As everyone adopts the same language and expression methods, linguistic barriers vanish at their root. Translators become obsolete—not because they exist, but because the drive for a unified language stems from natural evolution toward collective intelligence, not mere uniformity. These languages are inherently easy to learn, eliminating the need for redundant systems. Breaking down language barriers also erodes cultural divides. Meanwhile, as belief becomes purer, traditional religions gradually disappear; their valuable core ideas may be preserved as part of shared knowledge, but not as independent faiths. Likewise, political ideologies and ethnic distinctions fade as broader and deeper exchanges foster ideological unity. Differences remain only in division of labor—some excel here, others there—while humanity operates as a vast community, jointly exploring, innovating, and advancing society, generating resources that benefit individuals and the collective alike.

Thus, full interconnection is not merely a communication enhancement—it is an essential skill, an evolutionary path, a survival strategy. And with this foundation, another transformation soon follows: the ultra-intelligent domain, barely introduced, triggers yet another colossal evolution, ushering in a more disruptive yet more mature phenomenon.

## The Intelligent Planet

When people communicate without barriers and their ideas tend to converge on a holistic, macro level, sharing interconnected structures, a very subtle relationship actually emerges. That is, this spontaneous, invisible large-scale division of labor for a common goal raises the question: does it mean that this group is not actually made up of individual members? More radically, could it actually be a whole, or an enormous independent individual? A single person within it is more like a cell, each performing its role while being interconnected, organically forming a complete person. Each person contributes their abilities and supports each other, organically creating an entirely new species—a single super-intelligent being that dominates the Earth and near space—the Intelligent Planet!

To answer this question, or to explain this phenomenon, we might as well review what people's forms of thinking and physical shapes ultimately became in such a radical evolutionary process.

Considering that smooth information flow has become fundamental, people or groups can now discuss issues on a large scale and at great speed. As emotional elements diminish and structured language patterns emerge, communication is primarily rational. Disagreements are resolved through reasoning and verification, leading either to deeper exploration or to ending the discussion. Regardless of the outcome, everyone focuses on the matter itself without feelings of frustration, tension, or disdain over winning or losing. This is partly because subjective emotions are stabilized by an upgraded environment that fosters satisfaction and happiness, and partly because discussions aim to reach the best conclusion. Each party contributes data to support their perspective, and while the overall direction is rarely disputed, differences usually lie in details or viewpoints—essentially trade-offs and balancing acts. Over time, as information sources align and analytical capabilities improve collectively, disagreements become rare, and conclusions tend to be strikingly consistent. If inconsistencies occur, they usually stem from approaching the issue from different angles before merging perspectives. These differences are due to division of roles, not personal bias, as everyone provides information from their assigned viewpoint and collaborates toward a shared decision.

From a higher perspective, opinions converge completely, leaving no real conflict. To improve efficiency, tasks are divided among groups, and even separate matters are advanced in parallel. Final conclusions and outcomes are consolidated within their scope and preserved as collective wealth for society.
In handling specific tasks—such as gathering information, executing actions, and updating data—resources are essentially shared. For example, if someone named A needs a new duvet cover, A would first check the bed size, then browse an online platform, place an order, and use the item upon delivery. In the era of “new humans”, A could simply use integrated intelligent components in the brain to command a remote robot to measure the bed or retrieve size data from past orders, then filter available products and select the best option. Seller C would arrange shipment. This process could be even more flexible: A might delegate the task to B (a relative), who, once authorized, could perform all steps, including controlling A’s robot or accessing order history. After completing the purchase, B could, with C’s permission, even operate warehouse machinery and delivery vehicles. In reality, such manual steps would no longer be necessary because automation would handle all trivial tasks—but the behavioral model would still exist. With proper authorization, anyone could access resources, operate tools, sense conditions, and review information. In fact, most resources would not be privately owned but collectively managed, with responsibilities and permissions distributed through system governance. This ensures flexible, secure, and efficient resource utilization.

Thus, human thought becomes unified and collaborative, and resource use is based on sharing and security. The former fosters deep mutual understanding, while the latter erases boundaries. This spiritual and material harmony leads to a state of profound integration: your thoughts are mine, and mine are yours—complete unity of mind, form, and will. Humanity ceases to exist as separate individuals and instead functions like parts of a single organism, working seamlessly together. Ultimately, all humans, along with integrated intelligent components and peripherals, form a higher-order, omnipotent super-intelligent organism.
During this process of global human unification, Earth’s ecology undergoes dramatic changes. Historically, evolution produced countless species, creating a foundation for survival and progress. Some species learned to shape micro-environments—birds build nests, snakes burrow, bees make hives—while humans constructed roads, houses, and cities to improve living conditions.

Industrialization introduced pollution, harming environments suitable for human life. Events like London’s 1952 smog, which killed 4,000 people in a month, spurred ecological protection efforts. These measures aimed to improve human living conditions, even if framed as saving Earth or other species. When human needs arise, priority remains human survival, with mitigation of side effects. For example, water-control projects prevent floods and generate power, benefiting generations. Building dams disrupts ecosystems—fish can’t swim upstream—so humans intervene artificially. But such projects are indispensable for clean energy and water regulation. Similarly, when driving, avoiding a stray cat is ideal, but not at the cost of risking passengers’ lives or causing accidents.
As humanity evolves into a higher species, resource exploitation intensifies, and Earth’s current environment may no longer suffice. Large-scale projects proliferate, such as using seawater to cool massive server clusters. Though abundant, seawater’s salts corrode heat exchangers, and marine organisms reduce efficiency, prompting purification systems. As oceanic server farms expand, marine life declines. Yet without these clusters, humanity might not survive—just as modern humans would struggle in the wild without tools or fresh water. Eventually, Earth transforms completely, dominated by a single new species. Land, sea, sky, and near-space resources are exploited at unprecedented speed. Other species vanish—not by deliberate extermination but by obsolescence in the new era.

Ultimately, the Intelligent Planet becomes Earth’s sole life form, encompassing the entire planet and extending into nearby space and distant spacecraft as parts of one unified entity.

## Postscript

Before humans had evolved into the “new human”, space exploration had already been underway for many years. In the early stages, its symbolic significance was relatively greater, though it also achieved many tangible results, which, of course, were trivial compared to those of later periods. The development of any endeavor is like this: it takes time to grow from inception to immense significance. Modern weather forecasting relies on numerous methods, including satellites, and helps agriculture avoid many losses each year. Space exploration can greatly expand our understanding of things and our ability to gather resources, so it must continue. By the time the ultra-intelligent domain arrives, humans will have achieved remarkable accomplishments. By then, large starships will be able to travel freely, carrying solemn tasks and noble missions assigned by their home planet, roaming space, venturing to the stars and seas of the cosmos, and creating one miracle after another.

As physical distances continue to increase, even with more advanced technologies enabling ultra-high-speed or near-light-speed travel, this would only expand the scope of our exploration. It's similar to how we have airplanes today; however, flying from the Eastern Hemisphere to the Western Hemisphere still takes over ten hours, consuming a large part of the day. It just means that in the same amount of time, we can cover much greater distances than before. This is already a huge advancement, yet issues like connecting distant locations quickly, despite similar durations, still exist. Perhaps technologies like quantum entanglement could address such issues, but since this involves fundamental concepts of physics, its feasibility is still uncertain, so no conclusion can be drawn at this time.  

Assuming such interstellar communication mechanisms could be resolved and applied on a large scale, the Intelligent Planet would soon evolve into an Intelligent Galaxy: any planet or interstellar space suitable for expansion would be transformed into branches of Intelligent Planets and connected with other branches. In a manner similar to how multiple beings once merged to become the Intelligent Planet, multiple Intelligent Planets could combine into a single entity. No matter where they are located, or how differently their structures are built to suit local conditions, quick and high-throughput communication must be ensured.  

If the communication problem cannot be well solved — meaning ultra-long-distance instant connectivity cannot be achieved, or it can be achieved but not mass-produced, making it impossible to create high-throughput signal transmission lines — then the Intelligent Planet would be prioritized for development. Nearby planets would develop simultaneously, focusing on the closest ones first, aiming for high-throughput instant connectivity to form Intelligent Galaxies. For truly distant ones, connectedness would be maintained as much as possible; however, due to limited communication, if the issue remains unresolved over time, cognitive divergence would eventually occur, with each entity considering problems and executing tasks based on their own environment and perspective. In this case, distant Intelligent Planets would relate to Earth more like close siblings. Of course, with technological progress, it is believed that reunification will eventually occur, starting from nearby and extending outward, forming a unified Intelligent Galaxy.

As for further into the future, whether life forms will transcend material forms and become streams of supernatural consciousness? That will not be discussed here. Moreover, if that were truly the case, such forms might no longer be appropriate to call 'life,' but rather a form parallel to life yet of a higher order. Perhaps, by that time, there will be an article titled _Post Intelligent Galaxy Era_, first paying tribute to the optimistic, active, and intelligent post-intelligent stars, briefly reviewing the past, and then moving on to a general discussion exploring chapters further into the future.

For now, let us move forward bravely, maintain an optimistic mindset, demonstrate our intelligence through proactive efforts, and create the next brilliant tomorrow!
